     =============================== SchMdl Classe ==================================================================================================
     there are some classes with similar name like RepModel & RepMdlin
     'in' suffixed class will be used for internal use and without 'in' suffixed class will be used for API call
     Because sometimes there are more data in DB table ,all columns are not necessary to send to server but needed in
     internal app logic, for this reason 'in' suffixed is long version(all db columns as member) of that class.
